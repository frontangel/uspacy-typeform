	<p class="paragraph">This app will allow you to set up Smart-lead transfer from Type Form to Uspacy without writing any code.</p>

	<p class="paragraph"><b>App Features:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li class="list-item">Create a lead or contact and deal from every request received from the Type Form.</li>
		<li class="list-item">When creating a lead or contact with a deal, avoid creating a duplicate client by checking the phone/email in Uspacy.</li>
		<li class="list-item">Select a scenario for creating a repeat deal for an existing client.</li>
		<li class="list-item">Create a scheme for distributing new orders to sales managers for each specific form of Type Form website.</li>
		<li class="list-item">Conveniently choose without coding which Uspacy fields you want to transfer lead information to.</li>
		<li class="list-item">Update existing deals/contacts with additional information (such as traffic source) from new client orders.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="paragraph">And all this can be configured through the LeadBox service admin panel and easily changed later.</p>

	<p class="paragraph"><b>In addition to the lead data and their request, you can receive from Type Form:</b>
	<ul>
		<li class="list-item">Traffic source data (UTM tags)</li>
		<li class="list-item">Automatically fill in the source field in Uspacy</li>
		<li class="list-item">Choose the name of the created lead/deal</li>
		<li class="list-item">Subsequently send data from Uspacy to Google Analytics</li>
	</ul>
